# Core-Py Unit Design

This directory owns expensive internal design truth for logical units delivered by this repository. Code, schemas, tests, assertions, and automation remain authoritative when they can prevent drift directly. Shared Product behavior and cross-unit contracts remain read-only Hub truth under `../_shared/`.

Do not add a document for a directory inventory, a fact cheaply recovered from code, a one-off decision, or a cross-unit contract already owned by `../_shared/20-product-tdd/`. Put repeated physical-subtree hazards in the nearest `AGENTS.md`; put runtime, rollout, recovery, and environment truth in `../40-deployment/`.
