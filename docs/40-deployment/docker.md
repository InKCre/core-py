# Docker

## Artifact Contract

The multi-stage `Dockerfile` builds one canonical provider-neutral service image plus two
operational helpers:

- `service`: the canonical core code image published to GHCR and transferred unchanged to Heroku;
- `artifact` and `heroku-web`: compatibility aliases of `service` for local and preview builds;
- `heroku-release`: a lightweight no-op release guard containing no core code;
- `Dockerfile.postgrest`: the separately pinned PostgREST transport.

- Python and PDM versions are pinned by `.python-version` and the Docker build argument
- production dependencies come only from the frozen root `pdm.lock`
- the final image contains Core code, shared libraries, prompts, Alembic configuration, every
  migration revision, and a writable Core virtual environment with native `pip`
- checked-in Extension source, custom ZIP bundles, catalogs, and Extension-local environments
  are not image inputs
- the final process runs as the non-root `inkcre` user

The service has no entry point and defaults to `python scripts/container.py web`, which keeps
Heroku's shell-based `CMD` behavior explicit. Call other supported commands with the full prefix:

- `python scripts/container.py web`: start Uvicorn on `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- `python scripts/container.py db <command>`: run the explicit lifecycle surface documented in
  [database-contract.md](database-contract.md)
- `python scripts/container.py ready`: compatibility entry point for runtime-profile readiness

The image never embeds Extension code. During enable or cold restore, the Core
Extension Host resolves the Registry Release, selects its wheel through the same-origin Simple
index, rejects dependency plans that replace Core-owned Distributions, and installs the wheel
into `/app/.venv` with ordinary `pip`. Entry points are discovered through
`importlib.metadata`; there is no target overlay or `sys.path` mutation.

The canonical service contains `curl` for Heroku release logging and uses the same full default
command in Docker and Heroku. The separate release guard is deliberately harmless: Heroku config
vars are shared by every dyno in an app, so putting a migration owner URL there would also expose
it to the web process.

`Dockerfile.postgrest` wraps the digest-pinned upstream PostgREST image only to bind its
server port to Heroku's runtime `$PORT`. The upstream image has no shell, so the wrapper
copies one static BusyBox executable from a separately digest-pinned official image and
uses it only as the entry-point interpreter. JWT and database configuration remain runtime
inputs.

## Local Compose

`docker-compose.yml` defines the canonical local and SSH-transported topology:

- `postgres`: digest-pinned PostgreSQL 17 with pgvector and a health check
- `init`: a one-shot development-profile lifecycle initializer
- `core`: the same image using the unprivileged `inkcre_core` login
- `postgrest`: digest-pinned PostgREST using the unprivileged `authenticator` login

Start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The canonical agent-friendly entry point is `svc dev ensure database --repo . --json`.
Override direct-Compose ports with `POSTGRES_PORT`, `CORE_PORT`, and `POSTGREST_PORT`. Set
`INKCRE_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` to give each worktree or agent a separate network and volume:

```bash
INKCRE_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=inkcre-agent-a \
POSTGRES_PORT=55432 CORE_PORT=58000 POSTGREST_PORT=53000 \
docker compose up --build
```

Cleanup is bounded by the same project identity:

```bash
docker compose -p inkcre-agent-a down --volumes
```

Compose defaults are development-only; production credentials come from protected runtime
secrets.

## Health Semantics

- `/livez` is process-only
- `/readyz` requires a migrated database and completed runtime bootstrap
- the Compose health check deliberately uses liveness; routing platforms should use
  readiness before sending traffic

## CI Evidence

The artifact job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` builds the source image and PostgREST, then proves
the full fresh-database chain: duplicate init, JSON readiness, negative drift cases, the
production PostgREST wrapper binding from `$PORT`, JWT read/write and denial behavior,
duplicate deterministic reset, Alembic metadata, and web liveness/readiness. It uses no Neon
or Heroku state.

PR CI initializes a separate neutral runtime database, exports password-free role SQL and a
PostgreSQL 17 whole-database schema dump, and restores it as candidate validation. After strict
required checks admit that tree to protected `main`, `artifact-publish.yml` independently repeats
that export in the release workflow,
embeds its same-run schema, builds the canonical service image, and publishes the image commit tag
and immutable digest. First-party wheels are independently
built and published by `extension-publish.yml` only for changed Extension directories from the
same protected-main push. Application image promotion is not coupled to Extension publication.
The production controller is admitted by the successful exact-main artifact run and rechecks that
its source is still current `main`; it does not wait for duplicate checks on the merge commit.
Production pulls that digest and transfers the same image content to Heroku; it does not rebuild
core code. Only a successful production probe moves the mutable `stable` discovery channel.

When no local Docker-compatible runtime is installed, `svc.local.json` may select the
checked-in SSH provider implemented by `scripts/dev_database_provider.py` and
`scripts/remote-compose.sh`. It executes this same Compose file, records the remote daemon
identity, allocates dynamic loopback ports, and keeps cleanup instance-bounded. CI remains
the authoritative clean-environment container proof.
